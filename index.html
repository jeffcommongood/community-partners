The conference is designed to hold participants accountable by helping them recognize the harms caused by their conduct. Then the panelists, participant, and victim (when present), can come up with a collaborative solution designed to address those harms in a way that is restorative rather than punitive. Agreements focus on educational courses, referral to relevant local social services and community-based organizations, and reintegration into the community. RJP volunteers help victims, participants, and their communities to move forward in a positive direction. This aligns with the Yolo DA's mission to pursue truth and justice for victims and our communities with commitment, compassion, courage, and integrity.</p>"

Despite mothers’ best efforts, statistics show that these children suffer in a variety of ways from educational deficiencies to having lower occupational status and income as adults, among other issues. Meanwhile, the single mothers are plagued by feelings of guilt and inadequacy and often these families are living in poverty. At the core of SMS programs and services is community. We are a community of single mothers and children, providing weekly opportunities for community members to connect in a variety of ways. Being a single parent is difficult and lonely, but having others in similar situations to share questions and concerns and celebrate wins with is powerful. Additionally, our workshop and coaching programs are based on the premise that a single mother can be a professional “success” and a great parent, and the belief that neither the single mother nor her children are limited by this circumstance. Our single mothers are given the tools and encouragement needed to achieve their goals, while they and their children benefit from being a part of the SMS community. It takes a village to raise a child and for single mothers, Single Mom Strong is that village. Finally, our preschool and childcare programs were created to address the lack of affordable, quality childcare in the region.Our Preschool and Pre-K programs ensure high early childhood education is accessible to children of single mothers, with tuition starting at just 60% of retail rates. Our school School-Age program is open on all days elementary schools are closed to provide a safe, nurturing environment and an inexpensive solution for working single parents. With their children receiving quality care, mothers can focus on achieving education or career goals.</p>"
